            <p>I am a experienced financial analyst with a passion for leveraging data-driven insights to optimize business performance.

                I have extensive experience in financial analysis, planning and financial modelling, working across companies like KPMG and the industry.
                
                I'm very passionate about data analysis, interpretation, process automation and problem-solving. 
                
                My goal is to connect my financial knowledge with data analysis. 
            I believe that data can completely change how businesses work and make decisions and I want to be a part of that change. 
            I'm excited to use my financial experience to understand and use data to help companies make smarter choices.</p>
